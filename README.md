# Tutor-Me

Tutor Me is a web platform that connects tutors and students based on location. It is targeted towards high school students, and provides a service where students can find and hire local tutors, or offer their expertise in a subject as a peer tutor. The app was developed in a team of four with an agile scrum enviroment. HTML, CSS and JavaScript/jQuery were used to handle the frontend, while MongoDB, Node.js and other frameworks were used for the backend.

Resposibilities:
- Non-login and login homepage with functions
- Search functions and pages
- Review functions and pages
- Recommended functions in search page
- Update user picture function
- Backend profile updates

Demo: backend is currently being updated for compatibility with Heroku, however the web app can still be run locally. Meanwhile, screenshots of the app can found in the demo folder.

To run locally:
- Start the Mongo daemon ('mongod' command) in terminal or command prompt - MongoDB must be installed
- Open another instance of terminal or command prompt and in this shell:
  - Go to the root directory of the file (Tutor-Me file)
  - Run 'npm install' to install dependencies
  - Run 'npm start' to start web app
- Go to http://localhost:3000 to view the site
