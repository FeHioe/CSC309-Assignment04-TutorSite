# Tutor-Me

Tutor Me is a web platform that connects tutors and students based on location. It is targeted towards high school students, and provides a service where students can find and hire local tutors, or offer their expertise in a subject as a peer tutor. The app was developed in a team of four with an agile scrum enviroment. HTML, CSS and JavaScript/jQuery were used to handle the frontend, while MongoDB, Node.js and other frameworks were used for the backend.
